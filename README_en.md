# Velo: With a brush of light,we weave the fabric of code.

## Preface

After much contemplation, I finally decided to write this preface. Perhaps it will serve as a keepsake for the future.
Velo’s ambitions are grand. As an interpreted language, it aims to achieve extremely high development efficiency and outperform other interpreted languages in execution speed. It also strives to support powerful concurrency, JIT compilation… and so much more. Yet I know it’s an impossible goal. My time is limited—with school starting, even writing a simple I/O module takes weeks, let alone everything else. Besides, I’m nothing but a complete novice in this field. How could I ever accomplish such a monumental project?
Still, I want to give it a try. I remember a senior from the studio once said that a programmer has two lifelong dreams: to write their own operating system and to create their own programming language. Even if I can’t finish it, I must courageously try—if only to see which obstacle eventually stops me.
There’s still a long road ahead in my life. Though I know it may be impossible, I still hope that one day I can fulfill this dream. Even if by then my hair has turned gray, I will never regret the aspirations I held in my youth.

## The origin of the name "velo"

The name "velo" is derived from the English word "**velocity**", which translates to "速度" (sùdù) in Chinese. It signifies that Velo possesses extremely fast development efficiency and faster execution speed compared to other interpreted languages.



## Current Progress

Although time is limited, we are working hard on the development. Stay tuned!



## Special Thanks
